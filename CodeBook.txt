1) Data Source

This data analysis experiment uses the raw data provided in the project archive file downloaded from Coursera. 

2) Raw Data

The raw data that is used in the analysis are the following files:-

a) activity_labels.txt - This file is used to derive the Activity names corresponding to the activity codes. 
b) features.txt - This file is used to derive the variable names of all the 561 columns of the data.
c) test/subject_test.txt - This file is used to derive the subject id corresponding to each row of activity. 
d) test/X_test.txt - This file is used to get all the test data for 561 different variables captured for each activity. 
e) test/Y_test.txt - This file is used to get all the activities done by the subjects. 
f) train/subject_train.txt - This file is used to derive the subject id corresponding to each row of activity. This is the training set.
g) train/X_train.txt - This file is used to get all the training data for 561 different variables captured for each activity. 
h) train/Y_train.txt - This file is used to get all the activities done by the subjects. This is the training set.

3) Processed Data
The processed data gives the average value of certain (mean and standard deviation variables only) feature variables for each activity and each subject. 
This is how the processed datat was obtained. 
The training and the test data set for all feature variables (d & g) have been merged together to get single data set. 
To this data set, added the subject and activity data (c,f,e,h) so that all variables are mapped against activity and the subject who did the activity. 
Replaced the activity id with the activity name by using the activity_labels.txt file. 
Derived only the 'mean' and 'Standard Deviation' variables from the whole data set as per the project requirements. 
Finally, melted the wide data to derive all the variabes in one column and then grouped the data by Activity and Subject and derived the 
average value for all the variables. 

4) Field Names
Activity - This field denotes the various activities that were done using the smartphone. 
Possible Values are:-
WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

Subject - This field specifies the id of the person who did the activity. Values range from 1-30
